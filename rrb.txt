GOTOX SET ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Screen RAM 0
            Bits 7 - 0      Lower 8 bits of new X position to start drawing the next character.
    Screen RAM 1
            Bits 7 - 5      FCM Character data Y offset: 0 for no offset, !0 = 8 × the value is added to the character address.
            Bits 4 - 3      RESERVED, set to 0
            Bits 1 - 0      Upper 2 bits of new X position

    Colour RAM 0
            Bit  7          background/transparent pixels will not be drawn for subsequent characters, allowing layering
            Bit  6          the following characters will be rendered as background, allowing sprites to appear in front of them, even when sprites are set to background.
            Bit  5          RESERVED, set to 0
            Bit  4          GOTOX is 1, so not displaying characters.
            Bit  3          ROWMASK
            Bit  2          the following characters will be rendered as foreground, regardless of their colouring, allowing sprites to appear behind them.
            Bits 1 - 0      RESERVED, set to 0
    Colour RAM 1
            Bits 7 - 0      Pixel row mask flags

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 4BPP                      Full-Colour characters use 4 bits per pixel and are 16 pixels wide (less any right-hand side trim bits),
                            instead of using 8 bits per pixel. When using 8 bits per pixels, the characters are the normal 8 pixels wide.
** ROWMASK                  If set, then the pixel row mask is used to determine which pixel rows of the following characters should be rendered.
                            This can be used to vertically scroll characters using the Raster-Rewrite Buffer, by drawing each character twice, once
                            shifted down on the screen line on which it appears, and a second time, shifted up in the following screen line, and masked so that
                            only the pixel rows belonging to the scrolled character are displayed, and not data from either before or after that character’s data.
